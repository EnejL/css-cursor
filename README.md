# css-cursor

I have recently created a toolbox of CSS cursor properties in order to make it easier for other people (and myself) to browse through different cursor property values. The site layout was built using CSS Grid.

In the list I have not included the following values:

- default: the default cursor.
- initial: sets the value to default.
- inherit: cursor inherits the property from its parent element.
- URL: used to define specific, custom cursors.

I have not included these four values because I consider them either completely self-explanatory or outright redundant.
